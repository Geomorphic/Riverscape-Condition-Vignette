## Question / Problem
Environmental flow needs (EFN) are commonly accepted as essential ingredients for the survival of salmonids during  freshwater life histories. Yet very little information exits on the interface between EFN  in un-dammed rivers and how those are impacted by channel evolution.  

Low-Tech, Process-Based Restoration (LTPBR) has gained much attention as it increasingly demonstrates benefits for various freshwater species and their specific life histories. This project aims to demonstrate that LTPBR restores the EFN required by freshwater salmonids in the Skeena Watershed.  

-------
## Idea / Hypothesis
Using LTPBR to increase structure and complexity in the project river will improve the environmental flow needs (EFN) for salmonids.   

-------
## Methods
Environmental flow needs (EFN) are defined by five pillars that include: (i) Hydrology, (ii) Geomorphology, (iii) Biology, (iv) Water Quality, and (v) Connectivity. Using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) approach to monitoring of these five EFN pillars, the project will demonstrate that LTPBR restores EFN. The BACI design aims to show significant positive trends in each of the five EFN pillars as outlined below. 

### LTPBR

Critical salmonid habitat (spawning, migration, rearing) in the Skeena Watershed is often associated with response reaches where stream evolution (Cluer and Thorne, 2014) historically ranged between Stage 7 and Stage 0. Logging of these sensitive areas in 1980s has left these riverscapes *structurally starved*, and decades later, in evolutionary Stages 3/4/5, stages that are common associated as poor *geomorphic condition* (Wheaton et al., 2019), offering limited ecological value (Cluer and Thorne, 2014).  

To demonstrate successful process-based restoration, field-based measurements of structure, complexity and geoidicators will be employed as described below.  

#### 	Structure & Complexity

The RiverRAFT field protocol collects information on the physical habitat at several scales including, mico (hydraulic), meso (geomorphic unit), and macro habiat (reach) scale with the bulk of field-based information generated at the meso-habitat scale. Structure is defined as bedrock, boulders, beaver dams, and large wood debris / wood accumulations. Complexity is defined as off-channel habitat, or secondary habitat (e.g. eddy pool) in the mainstream. Both structure and complexity are tabulated in the field protocol. Indicators of structure and complexity are reported by the geoindicators, as described below. 

#### 	GeoIndicators

Geoindicators will be used to demonstrate signifiant change following restoration treatments. The geoindicators include: (i) proportion of active channel, off-channel and floodplain (Wheaton et al., 2019), (ii) Stream Evolution Model (Cluer and Thorne, 2014) and Stream Evolution Triangle (Castro and Thorne, 2018), (iii) Wood Loading (Wheaton et al., 2019), and (iv) Beaver Dam Density (Wheaton et al., 2019).

Each geoinidcator is reported categorically as poor, moderate and good at both the meso-habitat and reach scales. Geoinidcaotrs are tabulated and presented numerically at both the meso-habitat and reach scales, as per unit length (#/100 m) measures. Categorical assingments of poor, moderate, and good are grounded in the literature (e.g., pool spacing as per Montgomery et al., 1995). 

Geoindicators will be monitored before, shortly after, and each year following restoration to track the geoindicators over time. 

### Environmental Flow Needs

Environmental flow needs will be defined by surrogate metrics that represent each of the five mentioned pillars of EFN. Each pillar will be represented by a single surrogate metric. The methods outlined below are intended to show autonomous benefits to each of the EFN pillars; thereby, demonstrating that LTPBR can restore EFN for salmonids. 

#### 	Geomorphology

Geomorphic condition will be used as a surrogate for this EFN pillar. Geomorphic condition will be based on Wheaton et al., (2019) and field-derived SEM (Cluer and Thorne 2014). Field measurements of physical habitat will be aquired using the RiverRAFT field protocol to audit reach characteristics. RiverRAFT uses field-derived observations and measurements to determine SEM, REM, and SET values to contextualize geomorphic condition..   

#### 	Hydrology

The project stream currently has a surface water program operated by the local First Nation. The project stream has a single guage maintained by the First Nation. This surface water program will be used to derive metrics that discern a positive hydrological impact from the LTPBR treatments. Although not currently defined, an example metric such as the '# of days above 10%, 15%, 20% MAD' during salmonid-sensitive periods (e.g., August, September and October) would be the type of indicator that would demonstrate a positive hydrological impact.   

#### 	Biology

Understanding there are many potential biological surrogates, the surrogate chosen for this pillar is eDNA. Using BACI, eDNA sites will be distributed throughout reaches designated as poor 'geomorphic condition' - those reaches with migration and rearing issues (Map). Species richness, diversity and abundance will be used to demonstrate LTPBR will lead towards appreciable increases in biology. Sites will be sampled monthly during the summer and fall for the duration of the project (years).   

#### 	Water Quality

Stream temperature has been identified as a critical stressor in the project stream. Stream temperature has commonly been observed >15C during summer low-flows / salmon sensitive windows. Rearing Chinook and adult sockeye migration are both sensitive to increased stream temperatures during this window. Although not currenlty defined, an example metric such as the '# of days with peak hourly temp exceeding 15C, 16C, 17C, 18C, 19C, and 20C. Sites will be sampled continuously with stream temperature 'Tidbits', logging a sample every 10 minutes. 

#### 	Connectivity [Floodplain]

Connectivity between the surface water and groundwater systems is a critical fucntion for salmon life histories in freshwater. To demonstrate successful floodplain reconnection a series of indicators will be used including: (i) primary channel length, (ii) non-primary channel length, (iii) active channel area, (iv) active floodplain area, and (v) riparian vegetation area.

## Preliminary Results
The project stream is structurally starved, moderately incised, and in an alternate state when considering it geomorphic condition and preferred channel morphology.  

Wood Loading results indicate that much of Hanna Creek has poor wood loading. From Figure 1 it is evident that wood loading is insufficient at both the meso-habitat and reach scales.

Habitat Complexity results indicate that Hanna Creek is dominated by poor habitat but that is does have small pockets of good habitat punctuated throughout most reaches.

Floodplain Connectivity results indicate that Hanna Creek has lost much of its floodplain connection. Evident in Figure 3 is that downstream of the highway there is moderate connectivity, while above the highway there is very little connectivity. ![Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 12.14.35 PM](/Users/geomorphicoffice/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 12.14.35 PM.png)

Geomorphic Condition results corroborate the previous results by indicating that channel evolution is potentially in an alternate, degraded state. Potentially due to low wood loading (structural starvation), Figure 4 show much of Hanna Creek to be in moderate Geomorphic Condition with some poor as well as some good sections. ![Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 12.15.07 PM](/Users/geomorphicoffice/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 12.15.07 PM.png)

**Figure 4** - Hanna Creek, British Columbia showing much of the stream to be in poor to moderate geommorphic condition. 



In summary, Hanna Creek has: (i) poor wood loading, (ii) poor habitat complexity, (iii) moderate to poor floodplain connectivity, and (iv) moderate geomoprhic condition. These results donot lend themselves towards the type of habitat heterogeneity required to provide the neccessary environmental flow needs for the species and life histories that rely upon Hanna Creek. 

-------
## Preliminary Interpretations
Overall, Hanna Creek appears to be in poor to moderate condition. Planar habitat perpeturates most reaches and is not providing sufficient pool-riffle sequences for spawning and rearing salmon. Structural starvation appears to be a [secondary] driver transitioning Hanna Creek from pool-riffle to plane bed stream type. This is evidenced in the planform by low sinuosity. 

These results support previous finding from an EFN study conducted in Hanna Creek  (Anderson, 2015) which indicated that there was insufficient hydraulic conditions to meet life history needs of sockeye and coho salmon.

## Future Work and Questions

To explore the question that LTPBR restores EFN, it will be neccessary to demonstrate baseline conditions, before and after. A study design based on  the LTPBR geoindicators would be applied. Additional metric that would enhance the BACI study may include eDNA (demonstrating rewilding), along with surface water, groundwater, and stream temperature monitoring. This suite of indicators should be durable enough to demonstrate significant change in the EFN due to LTPBR treatments, at the reach scale.
